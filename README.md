# 30 Days of SQL 

I was challenged to complete **30 SQL problems in 30 days**, one each day, to sharpen my query writing, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

Well... I didn‚Äôt exactly stick to *one problem per day* , but I got them all done within my 30-day window, and that‚Äôs what really counts!

##  What‚Äôs Inside

Each day‚Äôs folder ( `Day01`, `Day02`, ‚Ä¶, `Day30`) contains:

* The **problem statement** (from LeetCode SQL challenges)
* The **solution breakdown**, including:

  * **Problem** ‚Äì summarized version of the question
  * **Thought Process** ‚Äì how I approached the problem step-by-step
  * **Solution Query** ‚Äì final SQL query
  * **Takeaway** ‚Äì what I learned or noticed from solving it

## Key Learnings

1. **Reading the problem carefully** is half the job. Most ‚Äútricky‚Äù SQL questions are about interpreting conditions right.
2. The most consistently used SQL syntax patterns:

   * `JOIN` (inner, left, and self joins popped up *everywhere*)
   * `GROUP BY` + `HAVING` 
   * `CASE WHEN` for conditional transformations
   * `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` like `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `LAG()` for ranking and comparisons
   * `CTEs (WITH ...)` for breaking complex logic into readable steps
3. Writing clean, readable SQL is more valuable than writing one-liners that no one can understand.

## üìé Repo Navigation

Each file is named by day, e.g.:

```
Day01
Day02
...  
Day30
